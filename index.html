        The LaFerrari is based on findings from testing of the FXX development prototype. and on research being conducted by the Millechili Project at the University of Modena. Association with the Millechili Project led to speculation during development that
        the car would weigh under 1,000 kg (2,205 lb), but a dry weight of around 1,255 kg (2,767 lb) was claimed. Only 499 units were produced, and each cost more than 1 million US dollars. The car was unveiled at the 2013 Geneva Auto Show, followed
        by Auto Shanghai 2013, 2013 Tour Auto Optic 2000, 2013 Supercar Chronicle, Italian Chamber of Commerce in Japan.

        The LaFerrari is the first mild hybrid produced by the Italian Automotive marque, providing the highest power output of any Ferrari road car whilst decreasing fuel consumption by 40 percent. LaFerrari's internal combustion petrol powerplant is a longitudinally-mounted
        Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout Ferrari F140 direct injection 65° V12 engine with a displacement of 6,262 cc (6.3 L) generating a maximum power output of 800 PS (789 hp; 588 kW) at 9,000 rpm and 700 N⋅m (516 lb⋅ft) of torque at 6,750
        rpm, supplemented by a 163 PS (120 kW; 161 hp) KERS unit (called HY-KERS), which will provide short bursts of extra power. The KERS system adds extra power to the combustion engine's output level for a total of 963 PS (708 kW; 950 hp) and a combined
        torque of 900 N⋅m (664 lb⋅ft). Ferrari claims CO2 emissions of 330 g/km. The engine's bore X stroke is 94 mm × 75.2 mm (3.70 in × 2.96 in) with a compression ratio of 13.5:1 and a specific power output of 94 kW (128 PS) per litre. It is connected
        to a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission.

        The car is equipped with carbon-ceramic Brembo brake discs on the front (398 mm) and rear (380 mm), The car is equipped with Pirelli P Zero Corsa tyres measuring 265/30 R 19 and 345/30 R 20 respectively. The car uses a carbon fibre monocoque structure
        designed by Ferrari's F1 technical director Rory Byrne, with a claimed 27 percent more torsional rigidity and 22 percent more beam stiffness than the Enzo. It has a double wishbone suspension in the front and a multi-link suspension in the rear.
        LaFerrari has a number of electronic controls including ESC, high performance ABS/EBD (anti-lock braking system/electronic brake distribution), EF1-Trac F1 electronic traction control integrated with the hybrid system, E-Diff 3 third generation
        electronic differential, SCM-E Frs magnetorheological damping with twin solenoids (Al-Ni tube), and active aerodynamics, which are controlled by 21 of the LaFerrari's onboard computers, to enable maximum performance.The body computer system is
        developed by Magneti Marelli Automotive Lighting.

        Ferrari states that the car has a top speed exceeding 217 mph (349 km/h), similar to the Enzo's top speed, however, it is capable of accelerating from a standstill to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.4 seconds, 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in under 7 seconds, and 0–300
        km/h (0–186 mph) in 15 seconds. Ferrari also claims that the car has lapped its Fiorano Test Circuit in 1:19.70 which is faster than any other road-legal car Ferrari has ever produced.

        The design of the V12 flagship received no input from Pininfarina, making it the first Ferrari since the Bertone-styled 1973 Dino 308 GT4 not to have Pininfarina bodywork or other styling. This decision is a rare exception to the collaboration between
        Ferrari and Pininfarina that began in 1951. However, Ferrari has stated that two new models designed jointly with Pininfarina have yet to be unveiled and that there are no plans to end business relations with Pininfarina.The cockpit stands out
        for its essentiality and the sportiness of the shapes, intended to convey the high level of performance of the car. There is a steering wheel with integrated controls and gear levers directly fixed to the steering column, a solution that allows
        better use in all conditions. The "bridge" which exists between the two seats, designed like a suspended wing, is home to other instruments linked to the dual-clutch gearbox. The instrumentation consists of a 12.3-inch (310 mm) TFT display with
        the option to choose between two layouts and can host data from the telemetry system.
